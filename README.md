# Bus Tracker

## This is fun and interactive code that allows you to see the Bus Route between MIT and Harvard (Date displayed just for show). This is an actual google map of Boston MA (created from mapbox) but you can even zoom out and see the entire world map. I added some css to the button and changed the map to the night-v1 style. I really like how the colors look on the page! Maybe not the easiest to read if you seriously looking for a street name but for this exercise, it works! I also added a default zoom to the page so that it opens up at 80% instead of 100% (for better visibility). 

### How to run: open the index.html file in a new browser window, watch as the map appears. Find the light blue map marker (currently marking MIT campus). Click on the yellow and pink button at the top right that says "CLICK HERE TO SHOW BUS ROUTE BETWEEN MIT AND HARVAD FOR AUGUST 24, 2021". When you click that button, watch as the blue map maker moves along the street from MIT campus to the Harvard campus... did you know the two were SO CLOSE to eachother.. I didn't. 

#### Room for improvement... Something that I would like to add would be a button that then shows you Harvard to MIT stops. And at each stop to have the stop name presented next to the map marker.
